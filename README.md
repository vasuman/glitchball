# Mechanics

A one-versus-one contest in which a player attempts to track and gain control of
a ball which they have to deposit to the goal. The opponent defends while the
player attacks. Players have the ability to glitch - i.e. transport themselves
to a certain point in the arena while keeping the opponent frozen in time.

# Code

This game is written mostly in Javascript and has a few shaders written in GLSL.

It also uses a [tiny WebGL wrapper](http://twgljs.org).
